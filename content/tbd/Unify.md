>UNIFYING THE EMERGING GLOBAL MOVEMENT FOR WORLD PEACE
>
>UNIFY orchestrates Global Synchronized Events that inspire community-driven action campaigns for World Peace. During these events, we invite people of all backgrounds to meditate, host local ceremonies, pray, and contribute to a more loving, peaceful world in their own way. By unifying at these times we create a living example of a fundamental truth, we are all one. Together, we can give rise to an emerging planetary culture that embraces the interdependence and well-being of all.

## Cohere + project 

The overall objectives of the Cohere+ project are:

1. To increase and enhance the self-knowledge and self-awareness of key actors and organisations in the European transformational social change field, so that the field is more visible to itself and its effectiveness in strategic alignment is improved;
    
2. To support and facilitate greater connections and more effective transdisciplinary and transnational collaborations within the field;
    
3. To increase the visibility and accessibility of the field to broader European society so as to increase participation and boost its potential for impact;
    
4. To educate change agents and citizens within and beyond the field, to build the field’s spheres of influence and thus leverage our collective power to co-create the future Europe we want to live in.

# Example 2-  Earth4all

# About

### Key people

## Theory of Change 

Earth4all suggests that there are two possible futures: 'too little too late' and 'The Giant Leap'. They are advocating for the 'giant leap', and they expand on what that entails here:

This scenario assumes societies embark on a new path to a sustainable world by 2050. What if we fundamentally reconfigure our economies, energy and food systems so that they work for both people and the planet? Climate change, financial turbulences, worldwide urbanization trends, growing numbers of natural disasters, impacts of fake news, migration: coping with the grand challenges of the 21st century needs a deeper quantitative and predictive understanding of complex systems. The science of complex systems provides us with new methods and novel ways of addressing these systems that were thought to be unintelligible only a few decades ago.

They also have a 'transformational economics commission', which explores the following themes:

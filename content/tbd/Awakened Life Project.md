"The Awakened Life Project is a bold, contemporary experiment in authentic spiritual awakening and the evolution of consciousness and culture. The visionary seed was planted at the abandoned mountain farm of Quinta da Mizarela in Central Portugal by co-founders Peter Bampton and Cynthia Lea Rose in 2007. Since then the Project has since flowered into a growing network of co-creators and communities dedicated to an evolving vision of manifesting the spiritual truth of unity in this world."

"We are a non-profit Association that offers retreats and volunteer programs to support the evolution of consciousness and culture."

The Awakened Life Project is situated in a beautiful and wild ecological reserve in the mountains of Central Portugal.

They describe themselves as:
- 'a bold, contemporary experiment in authentic spiritual awakening and the evolution of consciousness and culture'
- 'a growing network of co-creators and communities dedicated to an evolving vision of manifesting the spiritual truth of unity in this world'

## Their vision/philosophy

"What do we mean by Awakening? In short, we mean waking up from the dream of our separate, limited existence as a psychophysical self to the utterly liberating, indefinable yet tacit, mystery of who we really _are_ - the Spiritual Heart, Consciousness Itself.  
  
Consciousness, Spirit, God, the Divine Reality—whatever name we want to give the unnamable wonder of existence—simply IS.  
  
Free to take the shape of all experience and yet independent of all experience, we recognize that the deepest Truth of who we really are is always already here and now. This discovery signifies the ending of the story of separation and seeking that is the source of all human suffering, conflict and insanity, and the beginning of a Great Adventure - the adventure of Consciousness knowing and creating itself anew as our very own Awakened Life."

## Leading questions/problems
  
- "What would it be like for our energy and attention to be freed from fear, self-infatuation, selfishness and psychological suffering?"
- "What would it mean to be more interested in what is real and true than in how we feel from day to day?"
- "Is it possible for human beings to live together in a context of absolute trust, honesty and love in which all difficulties are faced and resolved with maturity?"

## Practice and Transformation

"Contemplating such questions within ourselves and with others opens us to infinite possibilities for human development, but bringing the potential for a new consciousness and culture into manifestation does not simply happen spontaneously as a result of spiritual insight and experience. Meeting the challenge of Transformation entails being fundamentally converted from seeking Truth to surrendering to Truth. We want to be liberated not only for our own sake, but also for the sake of the evolution of the human race. We want to take responsibility for Life and become living, breathing expressions of actualizing a new possibility on planet Earth. This is where commitment to ongoing spiritual practice and the creation of a spiritually awakened culture lies.  
  
To help to facilitate this emergence we are committed to a regular practice of meditation and ongoing group inquiry in the form of men's, women's and mixed groups, both in person and online. These groups provide a forum for the exploration and integration of the Awakening Process in all areas of life and are under the guidance of co-founders and teachers Cynthia Lea Rose and Peter Bampton. Through commited practice we ground ourselves ever more deeply in the liberating discovery of our essential prior unity and freedom."

- Ashram
	- "Quinta da Mizarela is a non-traditional Ashram that is the heart of this daring experiment called the Awakened Life Project. It is not primarily an ecovillage nor a permaculture farm but a unique container dedicated to nurturing the delicate process of Awakening. Located in Central Portugal, the Ashram is a small eden surrounded by hills and crossed by a small river and its waterfalls. Here, life unfolds in a simple way and in harmony with the ecological web of life."

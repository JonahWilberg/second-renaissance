## Why this course?

Our six episode course delves into the depths of our current civilizational transition as we take you through the fundamental concepts integral to navigating this period of great awakening.

Through an introspective and explorative approach we breakdown the complexity into easy to digest topics to inspire action and foster a deeper understanding of where we stand in this pivotal moment. Together, we traverse through crucial topics such as the cracks in modern civilization, the significance of views and values, the role of cultural evolution, and the journey from the first Renaissance to late modernity. By dissecting paradigms and grappling with cross-paradigmatic friction, we gain insight into the darkness preceding the dawn of a Second Renaissance.

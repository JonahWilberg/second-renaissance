_"I leave this session feeling encouraged and inspired. I especially appreciated the sense-making conversations with others. I loved hearing Sylvie's story straight from the heart. I now feel more connected to it, and especially to the people who also take part in this collective movement. A bunch of twigs can't break!"_ - Maria, a participant in our prototype Second Renaissance Course

Led by Life Itself co-founders and Second Renaissance project curators Rufus Pollock and Sylvie Barbier we will cover the following areas:

**Awareness:** Exploring our paths to the second renaissance. How did you come to be interested in this? If and when did you start noticing “cracks” in the foundations? What are the resonances amongst us?

**Renaissance:** Exploring what we see can arise? What kind of views and values do you think are needed going forward? What kind of changes in technology and institutions?

**Seeds:** What are the seeds of the second renaissance? Where should we plant and cultivate them? What kinds of greenhouses? What kinds of pockets of emergence are there?

**The course focuses on supporting your own exploration and discovery using small group discussion and sharing amongst the wider group.**

This format makes it suitable whether you’re a complete newcomer to the second renaissance or already have deep knowledge of the area.
Using dialog and inquiry in small groups with sharing back with the group as a whole. There will be brief introductions to key features of the second renaissance to frame and prompt discussion.

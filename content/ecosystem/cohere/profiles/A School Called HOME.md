>In the small Swedish town of Östervåla, thirty miles north of Uppsala, we are creating a school called HOME.
>
>It’s a school that grows out of the conversations we bring together around our kitchen table.
>
>It’s the fruit of the projects we led, the books we read, the organisations we built, the people we learned with and the friendships that formed us over the past two decades.
>
>And it’s a new beginning. Something we’re figuring out together as we go along, with the help of that web of friends and collaborators.
>
>HOME is a school the shape of a pocket. An air-pocket. A breathing space. A pocket of resistance and hope.

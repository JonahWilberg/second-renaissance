>The association is a union of people who want to shape a regenerative, life-promoting present and future together. A world in which life unfolds and we, as human beings, contribute to it joyfully and creatively.

>**Our Approach**
>
>Why are we here and what role do we want to play as human beings on earth?  
  >
>Some indigenous peoples still live today in the deep self-understanding of being custodians of the earth as human beings. They remind us of how we become effective as co-creators in the service of the unfolding of life on earth. We want to contribute to remembering this potential and to grow into this role.  
>
>One of the central goals of our association is to build an academy for aliveness and the application of original knowledge in modern times. In doing so, we explore indigenous approaches in a practical way and test their relevance for current challenges.

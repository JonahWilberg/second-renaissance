> "Good Grief Network (GGN) is a nonprofit organization based in the United States that brings people together to metabolize collective grief, eco-distress, and other heavy emotions that arise in response to daunting planetary crises.
> 
> GGN runs peer-to-peer support groups that help folks recognize, feel, and process their heavy emotions, so that these feelings may be transformed into meaningful action. With the help of Aimee Lewis Reau, LaUra Schmidt crafted GGN’s flagship program, “10 Steps to Resilience & Empowerment in a Chaotic Climate,”  which is inspired by the 12-Step family groups, specifically Adult Children of Alcoholics.
> 
> Good Grief Network creates spaces to gather in community, process the painful feelings and realities of our time, and commit to meaningful action."

This page documents the second phase (2021-2022) of Life Itself's [[ecosystem|ecosystem mapping]] work, including:

1. Background: A newly emerging ecosystem & What we know about it so far
2. Current focus: Mapping the ecosystem so that it becomes (more) self-aware, interconnected, resourced and effective
3. Overview of the "PIP" ecosystem for Paradigmatic, Integrative, and Pragmatic Change
4. Visualisations
5. Directory of organisation profiles
6. Collaborations: Preliminary research interviews & Partnerships

This work builds on the first phase (2019-2020) of ecosystem mapping work, which you can read about [[state-of-sensemaking-2020|here]]. 

## 1. Background: A newly emerging ecosystem

A newly emerging ecosystem of individuals, organizations and initiatives around the world has begun to form in recent years. We know that many of them are trying to create change, often by shifting how we make sense of the world and how we engage with one another — in short, by engaging in sense-making and culture-making.

But there is still a lot more to learn about this newly emergent space. For example: **What are its defining characteristics? How do organizations differ, and how are they similar? What _is_ this space? What are the other ecosystems to which it is interconnected? And how will it evolve?** 

Better understanding of the ecosystem could help it to become more known, interconnected, resourced, and effective.

### Previous work: What we know about the ecosystem so far

We have noticed and begun mapping an emerging ecosystem. Its nature, boundaries and name are not yet fully defined. In the previous, [[state-of-sensemaking-2020|first phase]] of our work, we identified **some of its key features: 

>There is a focus on systems, emergence, coherence, sovereignty, sensemaking as buzzwords, along with activism, governance, and regenerative culture. This is characterised by a strong lean towards spirituality (mindfulness) and the relationship between inner and outer life. At a higher level, we have identified three core thematic areas which tie together the varied groups in the space: _collectivism, (w)holism, and counterculturalism and culture-making._ 
>
>Beyond this thematic overlap we have identified four major areas of activity: physical spaces, research, media/publishing and events. Nonetheless, it has been notable that many organisations have shifted to multi-channel working across a number of these (e.g. producing media content as well as running retreats and events).

## 2. Current focus: Mapping the ecosystem so that it becomes (more) self-aware, interconnected, resourced and effective

This project seeks to map the emerging ecosystem around social change for a new paradigm. We're seeking to provide an overview of the organizations in the space and better understand what they focus on, by what means, and what ties them together. We hope from this we can start to give a more coherent shape, name and set of key terms to the space.

We are undertaking research to gather information on organizations, communities and individuals that are potentially part of this ecosystem – as well as the connection to nearby spaces. 

The first stage of the project involves the creation of a directory, outlining the types and areas of focus of these organizations. Over time, we plan to conduct more in-depth analysis to map the ecosystem and chart how actors relate to each other across a number of dimensions.

### Why Map?

**Currently, the ecosystem is largely uncharted and undefined -- making it hard to discover, navigate, and engage with.** Furthermore, within the ecosystem, efforts are often duplicated or not as strategically aligned as they could be. We hope that mapping the ecosystem helps it to become (more) visible, self-aware, interconnected, resourced and effective.

>Charting this new territory is valuable for two main reasons. **First, and most importantly, mapping makes it identifiable and visible.** This supports engagement with the broader “mainstream” which is vital as we move from philosophizing about social transformation towards taking the kinds of action that make it a reality. **Second, it helps the ecosystem’s coherence, cohesiveness and self-awareness.** This supports connection both within and without the space leading to greater and better collaboration. It supports a better division of labor meaning greater efficiency and effectiveness . And, finally, it supports members to situate themselves and their work in a broader context.

## 2. Preliminary Research Interviews

As part of our preliminary research, we undertook some conversational interviews in order to get a better sense of what is going on within the space and how people are seeing it. You can read the interviews here:

## Directory of organisation profiles

The site is one output from our ongoing efforts to map an emerging ecosystem. It provides a growing directory of organizations, communities and individuals organized by theme and activity.



## Disclaimer

We emphasize our work here is clearly preliminary and is limited by both our resources and knowledge. Based on snowball sampling starting from our contacts it necessarily and obviously displays clear biases e.g. geographically to Europe versus the rest of the world, and thematically in terms of areas chosen etc. We welcome [feedback](https://lifeitself.org/contact) to help improve it.

Specifically, we are doing our best to give as accurate a representation of each organization we have listed. However, like everyone we make mistakes. If you believe the listing for your organization should be changed then please [contact us](https://lifeitself.org/contact) and we'll correct it as soon as possible.

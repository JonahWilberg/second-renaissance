## 1. Background: A newly emerging ecosystem

A newly emerging ecosystem of individuals, organizations and initiatives around the world has begun to form in recent years. We know that many of them are trying to create change, often by shifting how we make sense of the world and how we engage with one another — in short, by engaging in sense-making and culture-making.

But there is still a lot more to learn about this newly emergent space. For example: **What are its defining characteristics? How do organizations differ, and how are they similar? What _is_ this space? What are the other ecosystems to which it is interconnected? And how will it evolve?** 

Better understanding of the ecosystem could help it to become more known, interconnected, resourced, and effective.

### Previous work: What we know about the ecosystem so far

We have noticed and begun mapping an emerging ecosystem. Its nature, boundaries and name are not yet fully defined. In the previous, [[state-of-sensemaking-2020|first phase]] of our work, we identified **some of its key features: 

>There is a focus on systems, emergence, coherence, sovereignty, sensemaking as buzzwords, along with activism, governance, and regenerative culture. This is characterised by a strong lean towards spirituality (mindfulness) and the relationship between inner and outer life. At a higher level, we have identified three core thematic areas which tie together the varied groups in the space: _collectivism, (w)holism, and counterculturalism and culture-making._ 
>
>Beyond this thematic overlap we have identified four major areas of activity: physical spaces, research, media/publishing and events. Nonetheless, it has been notable that many organisations have shifted to multi-channel working across a number of these (e.g. producing media content as well as running retreats and events).

## 2. Current focus: Mapping the ecosystem so that it becomes (more) self-aware, interconnected, resourced and effective

This project seeks to map the emerging ecosystem around social change for a new paradigm. We're seeking to provide an overview of the organizations in the space and better understand what they focus on, by what means, and what ties them together. We hope from this we can start to give a more coherent shape, name and set of key terms to the space.

We are undertaking research to gather information on organizations, communities and individuals that are potentially part of this ecosystem – as well as the connection to nearby spaces. 

The first stage of the project involves the creation of a directory, outlining the types and areas of focus of these organizations. Over time, we plan to conduct more in-depth analysis to map the ecosystem and chart how actors relate to each other across a number of dimensions.

### Why Map?

**Currently, the ecosystem is largely uncharted and undefined -- making it hard to discover, navigate, and engage with.** Furthermore, within the ecosystem, efforts are often duplicated or not as strategically aligned as they could be. We hope that mapping the ecosystem helps it to become (more) visible, self-aware, interconnected, resourced and effective.

>Charting this new territory is valuable for two main reasons. **First, and most importantly, mapping makes it identifiable and visible.** This supports engagement with the broader “mainstream” which is vital as we move from philosophizing about social transformation towards taking the kinds of action that make it a reality. **Second, it helps the ecosystem’s coherence, cohesiveness and self-awareness.** This supports connection both within and without the space leading to greater and better collaboration. It supports a better division of labor meaning greater efficiency and effectiveness . And, finally, it supports members to situate themselves and their work in a broader context.

## 3. Overview of the "PIP" ecosystem for Paradigmatic, Integrative, and Pragmatic Change

We sense that a new ecosystem, or ecosystem of ecosystems, is emerging. A growing number of people, organizations and initiatives are taking alternative approaches to social change, which diverge from both mainstream and progressive action within civil society and the social economy.

The ecosystem we explore is still emerging and ill-defined. There is no one name for this ecosystem, with different organizations favouring different terms. As mapped, it is quite broad – even disparate. Nevertheless, there are commonalities.

**Most importantly, this ecosystem has a _novel_ approach to social change. Specifically, an approach that is simultaneously paradigmatic, integrated, and pragmatic.**

Secondly, there are a variety of commonalities in outlook and approach. The most noteworthy identified so far we have termed: post-individualism, (w)holism and culture-making (in the form of new norms and narratives).

There is also a focus on complexity, systems and emergence, on developmental models, spirituality and practice, and on sensemaking, different forms of knowledge and global-local activism. Other commonalities include an interest in decentralized governance, new narratives, alternative social imaginaries and regenerative culture.

Nonetheless, the boundaries, relationships and patterns of influences in the ecosystem remain blurry, with our present awareness feeling like it only touches the tip of the iceberg. Questions that remain unclear include who exactly comprises the ecosystem, how activities and visions relate to one another, where the coherences and tensions lie and how it might evolve.

### "PIP": A Novel Approach to Social Change

The defining feature of this ecosystem is its **_novel_** **approach to social change**. Specifically, the combination of being paradigmatic, integrated, and pragmatic. We emphasize that it is the combination of all three that is important and distinctive.

#### Paradigmatic

There is the belief that the change required is **paradigmatic**. That is to say, it seeks a transition of the entire social paradigm at both a systems and "ontological" (worldview and narratives) level. This contrasts with approaches that either simply seek reform e.g. making market liberalism better, or transformation that is deep but only in a given area e.g. transforming our structures of economic production and ownership but leaving base assumptions about who we are and how we relate to the natural world untouched.

#### Integrative

It identifies the need to incorporate methods and routes to change spanning a variety of fields and "locations" (e.g. personal, cultural, institutional etc). One central and basic example common to most (though not all) actors is the belief that inner and outer transformation have to go hand in hand. In Integral terms it is "all-quadrant" and in particular, prioritises the neglected "inner" quadrants.

#### Pragmatic

Participants are actively engaging with wider society for the purposes of social transformation. This sets it apart from groups which may be doing large amount of inner work but without connecting this directly and explicitly to broader social change, for example certain parts of the spiritual, developmental and psychedelic communities.

### Core Characteristics: Post-individualism, (W)holism, Culture-making

Beyond the three pillars listed above, we also identify three high-level commonalities in outlook and approach: post-individualism, (w)holism and counterculturalism.

#### Post-individualism

Post-individualism takes two forms. First, a focus on groups rather than just individuals as a primary unit of analysis, and the idea that we must shift our engagement outwards from ourselves and towards a more widely beneficial orientation. Note that, unlike traditional "collectivism" (a term we previously used but abandoned due to its connotations), this does not entail abandonment of individualism, but the inclusion of its positive aspects back into group-centric concepts. The second form of post-individualism shows up as a broad commitment across the ecosystem to actually operating in networked and communal ways.

#### Wholism

What we have termed (w)holism (we use the 'w' to signify consideration of wholes, as well as operating holistically) refers to the views taken of social phenomena, social change and simply the world at large. There is a widely shared understanding of the world as a gestalt object, be this under the banner of interbeing used by Buddhist and more spiritual actors, the complex systems terminology used by groups such as the International Bateson Institute or the 'holon' and integral' labels taken up by Ken Wilber and the integral movement.

As can be seen by the paradigmatic focus and integrated approaches which we have identified as delineating the ecosystem itself, this (w)holism gives rise to a problem diagnosis which targets a deeper whole giving rise to negative social outcomes. These fundamental ways of approaching social change stem from a (w)holistic perspective more broadly, a fact which is further seen in the use of terms such as the metacrisis or polycrisis.

#### Culture-making

Counterculturalism for us is a desire to go beyond the dominant norms and narratives. This includes the norms of the progressive movement more broadly -- perhaps its most surprising and interesting aspect. We also emphasize the culture in counterculturalism: for us, it is concerned with shifting the very foundations, worldviews and assumptions of our current order. In this sense it is a form of "culture-making".

To use the Wilberian terminology, there is a desire to move beyond the 'green' developmental stage which is currently taken to characterise Western liberal societies, and much of the progressive movement as a whole. This leads actors in the ecosystem to be more open to questioning or dispute social and political positions that may be understood as norms not just in wider society, but also those (for example understandings of inclusivity) within progressive circles themselves.

### Language and Buzzwords

The language of the ecosystem draws heavily on concepts such as complexity, systems and emergence, developmental models, spirituality and practice, and on sensemaking, different forms of knowledge and ‘cosmo-local’ activism. Other commonalities include an interest in decentralised governance, new narratives, alternative social imaginaries and regenerative culture.

### Activities

Emerging organizations and individuals are opting towards 'teal' style collaboration and community building in order to maximize resources as a generalist, lateral way of operating comes into view as a more effective way of tackling systemic problems.

We have identified four major areas of activity: physical spaces, research, media/publishing and events. Nonetheless, it has been notable that many organizations have shifted to multi-channel working across a number of these e.g. producing media content as well as running retreats and events.

## 2. Preliminary Research Interviews

As part of our preliminary research, we undertook some conversational interviews in order to get a better sense of what is going on within the space and how people are seeing it. You can read the interviews here:

## Disclaimer

We emphasize our work here is clearly preliminary and is limited by both our resources and knowledge. Based on snowball sampling starting from our contacts it necessarily and obviously displays clear biases e.g. geographically to Europe versus the rest of the world, and thematically in terms of areas chosen etc. We welcome [feedback](https://lifeitself.org/contact) to help improve it.

Specifically, we are doing our best to give as accurate a representation of each organization we have listed. However, like everyone we make mistakes. If you believe the listing for your organization should be changed then please [contact us](https://lifeitself.org/contact) and we'll correct it as soon as possible.

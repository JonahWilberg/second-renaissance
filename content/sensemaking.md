title: Sensemaking

# Purpose of mapping

## Our current focus is on **sensemaking**. 

Rather than, for example, catalysing connections in the field.

The current intention of this phase of ecosystem mapping: provide more/better ways to understand this ecosystem and its relation to broader social change ecosystem. 

This work could take many forms e.g.
- Visualizations 
- Written analysis
- Collecting novel data e.g. text collection to do topic analysis or concept clustering

# What is a map?

- A broad visual of the landscape of what you're focusing on, and the ability to navigate around it, e.g. https://twitter.com/exgenesis/status/1562059107233894402/photo/1
- A map may consist of:
  - Nodes, e.g. ideas, projects, communities, or goals
  - Proximity of mapped elements/nodes

See [[related-efforts]] for examples of related mapping efforts.

# Current Questions 

## How do we identify "centers" of the field/"tribes"?

- Data-driven; gut instinct; or ask people in some way (or combination)
- What is a "center"? E.g.
  - A community: a group of people that gather in some way whether in person or online, and who are united by some shared values and interests
  - ...

## What are the "nodes" in the map?

E.g.:
- Thinkers
- Hubs
- Communities
- Projects
- Organizations
- Concepts

## What supports sensemaking...?

### Of an organization or project?

- Quick sense: what are they trying to do and how are they doing it?
- Cf "What information do we try to capture about orgs in the second renaissance wiki?", https://github.com/orgs/life-itself/discussions/950

### Of an emerging field?

- Identifying "centers", or communities, within a field may serve as scaffolding to support sensemaking of the broader landscape

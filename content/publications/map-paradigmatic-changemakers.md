This is a map of the “paradigmatic changemaking” ecosystem. It shows some of the different communities, movements and spaces (primarily in the Global North) that aspire to and/or act to foster paradigmatic change. It aims to give a sense of how proximate some of these communities are, and it provides some examples of organisations, projects, individuals and key concepts that form their core. We hope that this overview can stimulate playful discussion on who and what is part of the ecosystem, as well as an exploration of the key points of alignment and divergence within the space.  

This map was produced by Matt Osborn and the Life Itself team. We recognise that it is far from comprehensive, and is still indicative at this stage. It is based largely on the team’s intuitive understanding of the relations between different communities, individuals and ideas in the space, and does not claim to be a fully accurate or the only possible representation.

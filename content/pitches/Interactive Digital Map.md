## Problem

**What is the "emerging ecosystem"?**

More and more people are talking about a vaguely recognisable emerging ecosystem, but people are using different names and no one has a clear definition of what it is exactly. Therefore, it is hard to make sense of what the emerging ecosystem is and therefore it is hard to talk about it, collectively refine understanding of it and support its development. 

## Appetite

- 4 weeks at roughly 4d/week with a team of:
  - Catherine
  - Elisa 
  - Matt
- i.e. 48 person days
- Plus 1 week "buffer" time, i.e. 12 person days
- Max. 60 person days in total

## Solution

## Rabbit Holes

## No Gos

- The focus of this pitch is on **sensemaking**. This corresponds with one of the needs identified in the [Cohere+ Mapping Needs Analysis](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2_H2SgpddOXs5-5q7iz4p9O2LBQSf0iwyJo7YYbaHo/edit#heading=h.r9bvzt2vfaa4): "Learning from the Field & Building on Collective Experience". What this means is that we are *not* designing visualisations primarily to support the other needs identified in the Cohere+ Mapping Needs Analysis: 1) Strategic Alignment, 2) Finding Relevant Connections, 3) Inspiration & Encouragement  -- although this work is likely also to support those needs in some way.

### SCQH

#### Situation

- **More and more people are talking about what we are calling the "Second Renaissance" ecosystem**, although people are using different names, e.g. Metamodern, Integral, Regenerative, Liminal Web, Metacrisis, Game B. 
- **More and more people are trying to map and make sense of this ecosystem**, e.g. Catalist, Limicon, Gaianet, Gathering of Tribes project.
- **There is a growing, but vague sense of alignment and recognition between people who are part of or aware of this ecosystem**. This can be through (probably a combination of the following):
  - recognising certain thinkers (e.g. oh yeah I've heard of Daniel Schmactenberger, or Joanna Macy, or John Vervaeke) 
  - sharing certain practices (e.g. oh yeah, I meditate/do Circling/do Ecstatic Dance/do other self-development or psychotherapeutic practice)
  - recognising certain virtual or physical gathering places (e.g. oh yeah, I've been to X intentional community; I listen to The Stoa; I went to the Microsolidarity Gathering; I go to Intentional Society; I'm active on X forum etc.)
  - shared ideas about "what's needed" (e.g. need for regeneration vs sustainability, need for emotional processing and inner work, need for more collective or communal ways of being, need for development of consciousness, need for somatic awareness)
  - shared analysis of "what's wrong" or what needs to be transformed (e.g. there is a metacrisis/polycrisis; we need to move beyond modern and/or colonial paradigm/consciousness; current social and environmental crises are not just technical or scientific issues, but also cultural crises)

#### Complication

- **There is no clear name or definition for the ecosystem**. So when talking with others, there can be a vague sense that we're talking about the "same space", but it's not clear that we really are talking about the "same space". Because...what *is* "the space"? How would you define it? How would I define it? How would they over there define it?
- **It's hard to see beyond one's own bubble**. My view of the ecosystem is partial, based on my own exposure to certain thinkers, ideas, practices, places, people, etc. A lot of people in my network might be familiar with X, so it might seem central to the ecosystem to me, but X might be on the periphery of your network/ awareness.

#### Question

- What is our (Life Itself team) best definition of the "Second Renaissance" (ecosystem)?
  - How do we go about defining something emergent?
- What would help people to have a better understanding of what the Second Renaissance (ecosystem) is? So that: 1) People who are part of it/aware of it can talk about it with each other, refine our understanding of it together, and contribute to its development; 2) We can talk about it with people who are unfamiliar with it and introduce them to the concept and how to learn more about it or get involved
  - What information would it be useful to gather?
  - How can we present the information in a way that is clear, informative, and engaging? 

#### Hypothesis

- Rather than trying to define "the ecosystem", we try to define "Second Renaissance", which might be one centre of a broader ecosystem -- or one ecosystem in an ecosystem of ecosystems. 

## Rough Work
### SCQH Brainstorm
#### Secondary Questions

- How might we get a good "overview" of the ecosystem? Is that even possible?
- What is our best definition of our "centre" (where "our" perspective is "Life Itself's" perspective, insofar as such a thing can exist)? Even if it is not *the* centre, can we at least try to define *a* centre? 
  - How could we arrive at a definition?

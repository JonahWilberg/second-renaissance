# About

Our current civilization is crumbling, leading to a period of crisis and potential rebirth â€“ what we could term a "second renaissance."

This project and website seek to provide an entry-point -- a **gateway** -- for people to discover and make sense of this emerging moment and field. A bit like  a curated art gallery for an emerging area of art.

## Who is involved

This project was initiated by [Life Itself][] with support from a variety of partners and collaborators.

It is now led by a curatorial team with participants from several organizations. We're also privileged to have ongoing input from an amazing set of advisors.

## Why: Background and Motivation

At Life Itself we've been working in "this space" for a decade. 

We started mapping this emerging ecosystem formally in 2019/2020 and produced our first report "The State of Sensemaking" In September 2020 followed by the much more thorough and detailed "PIP changemakers ecosystem report" in 2021/2022 (PIP stood for paradigmatic, integral, pragmatic and was our first effort at providing a specific characterisation of this emerging ecosystem).

This present work both builds on this mapping work and represents an evolution.

Specifically, weâ€™ve increasingly seen the need to be able to present these ideas and emerging ecosystem to others in an accessible way. This is based both on our own personal experience and from discussions with many others.

> [!example]
>  Recently one of our team was talking to "Sam", an old friend from college. They were trying to explain to Sam what we are working on:
>  
> "I start out with the climate crisis which he obviously gets. However, quickly I'm using quite a few terms like polycrisis, metacrisis or teal and I realize these are a bit jargony. Even terms like modernity and cultural paradigm aren't really that familiar. Sam is interested and asking me lots of questions. We talk for an hour and even then we've only just scratched the surface. I realize there are a lot of roots here beneath the surface, there's a lot there.

> **I want to be able explain it in a reasonably simple way, and I want an accessible resource I can point Sam to where he can get started and find out more if he wants  ...**

## What: A Gateway

In short, we need a **gateway or portal** to this space.[^1] A useful gateway provides:

[^1]: We acknowledge that there is still debate and discussion about if there is a "a space" or multiple related ones etc â€“ see https://secondrenaissance.net/publications/overview-ecosystem-names. In fact, this is another good motivation for this project: providing something of a "rosetta stone" that makes it easier for "insiders" to see each other and to make it easier for outsiders to see the commonalities.

- A name so people can easily remember and refer to it 
- Accessible presentation of key ideas, themes etc
- Pointers to more info and pathways to get involved
- Situated relative to things people know which provides both the "oh, ok i know that part" feeling as well as social credibility "oh this connects to these other areas that are already known"
##  How: Intro, news and wiki

What that means is we plan to provide (at least):

- **Intro**: to second renaissance and key themes and concepts
- **Newsletter**: to provide a simple, curated and accessible way in to both discover ideas (one per issue) and news
- **Wiki and/or forum**: as space for community and contribution

These three parts complement each other. A wiki on its own can be bewildering, overwhelming, and a bit scary for newcomers. A newsletter on its own does not have the richness of a wiki knowledgebase and does not offer an avenue for contribution. By offering both with a *clear set of principles / vision* you can get best of both worlds.

## Deeper motivation: five whys

We the initiators for this project want to create a portal/gateway for the "second renaissance" because â€¦

- Want more people to get involved in second renaissance type stuff (ideas, projects etc), especially people on the edge or close by (and eventually broader society to see) because â€¦
- Want a movement for second renaissance type stuff because  â€¦
- Want a "second renaissance" and a paradigmatic transition to happen ...
- We want that because we see that is key to addressing the (meta)crisis we're in and bringing forth a radically wiser, weller world (see the front page of this website ðŸ˜‰)

## Gallery metaphor

Imagine the world or art where there is all kinds of different art going on. Suppose weâ€™re noticing a new type of art emerging but it doesnâ€™t even have an agreed name yet. Itâ€™s hard to find and even talk about  â€“ you go to some show in someoneâ€™s basement and feel a vibe etc but hard to even describe to your friends (remember thereâ€™s no name etc).

To help, we propose to create a gallery to help showcase this new kind of art so people can more easily find it and talk about it â€“ to highlight a center of an emerging field.[^2]

[^2]: to use Christopher Alexander terminology.

The gallery has a vision statement and in curating it brings certain sets of artists together to really present them to the public and to that community. Both so the broader society can see them â€“ and so they can see themselves.

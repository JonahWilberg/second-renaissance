## Theory of Change 
  
**Spirituality** is understood as an innate human quality, that pre-exists cultural or religious differences, that stems from a unified reality and that is grounded in connection and love. As such, it is an essential element for human flourishing.  
  
**Moral** development should explore the core values and ethical narratives that we want to see in the world  
  
**Social** development is about celebrating and promoting human diversity within an essential unity, and  
  
**Cultural** development should foster an understanding of what shapes identity and belonging within an appreciation of interconnectedness and service to others.

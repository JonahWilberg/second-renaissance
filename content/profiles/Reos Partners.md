## Theory of Change 

Reos Partners makes 'systems change' central to their strategy and efforts, and they aim to do it in a few different ways. First, on large and small scales; they believe systems change requires efforts on both levels. Next, they believe that transforming existing structures, as well as building new structures is an important focus of systems change.

# Description

**Blue Ridge Rites of Passage is a recently formed deliberately developmental space which aims to guide young adults through a meaningful transformation process. The program started due to the lack of available spiritual education programs for youths and young adults, as well as the need for spiritual education in the metacrisis.**
# Vision

# Core Values

 **The concept of ‘belonging’ is at the heart of the program, as it aims to give young adults the opportunity to establish and feel a deep sense of belonging with the earth. The idea or practice of a ‘rite of passage’ is something that is, for the most part, mostly used metaphorically, although the actual practice seems like an important one.**
# Program(s) Structure

**BRROP’s main program is Becoming and Belonging, which centers around a four day vision quest. The entire program, which lasts more than six months, is split up into 3 phases: severance, threshold, and incorporation. In the severance section, there is a long process of preparation for the vision quest; the threshold includes the vision quest itself, which is a four day immersive experience in nature, where one is meant to be entirely on their own and be with themselves. Incorporation is the process after the vision quest, which some of the practices also mentioned in severance.**
# Practices

Group council, 1-on-1 coaching/mentoring, and medicine walks.

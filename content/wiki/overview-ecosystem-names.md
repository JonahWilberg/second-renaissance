In recent years, we have observed the emergence of a global network of people and organisations who are acting to catalyse, steward and accelerate what we have called a "[Second Renaissance](https://secondrenaissance.net/intro)": a major civilisational transition from modernity to a new cultural paradigm. We refer to this growing network as the "Second Renaissance movement" or "Second Renaissance ecosystem". 

However, we recognise that the ecosystem's identity is far from singular or clearly defined. Moreover, while those that we would consider to be part of the Second Renaissance movement tend to resonate with and be motivated by a particular meta-narrative,[^1] there can be significant divergence in terms of values, diagnoses, aims, approaches, etc., at a higher level of concreteness and specificity. 

Some of this diversity is reflected in the language that tends to be used across different parts of the ecosystem. Specifically, different groups and individuals within the space are using a range of names and terms to refer to:
- the period of civilisational transition we inhabit, or defining features of it (e.g. Great Turning, Second Renaissance, Metacrisis, Polycrisis)
- the new paradigm or approach that is emerging (e.g. Metamodern, Integral, Regenerative, Game B)
- the ecosystem itself (e.g. Liminal Web, Emergentsia)

In this post, we briefly outline the reasons for choosing the term "Second Renaissance", and provide an overview of some of the other most widely used names and terms. It is intended as a resource to learn more about each term, its history, and the thinkers, perspectives and communities that tend to be associated with it. As we add more information over time, we hope that it will contribute towards a deeper understanding of the areas of overlap and divergence within the Second Renaissance ecosystem.

# Why "Second Renaissance"?

The “Second Renaissance” refers to a major civilisational transition that is currently underway: from the paradigm of modernity, which is breaking down, into what comes next. The Second Renaissance is a time between worlds – a period of civilisational crisis and awakening. In our [introduction to the Second Renaissance](https://secondrenaissance.net/intro), we articulate four core premises of what we see as the underlying meta-narrative:

>1. **Real risk**: There is a real risk of civilisational collapse and large-scale destruction of life due to intertwined ecological, political, social, and meaning crises.
>2. **Root cause**: The root cause of these crises lies in the cultural paradigm of modernity: in entrenched individual and collective ways of being, which are conditioned by modernity’s logic and values. 
>3. **Radical response**: We are unable to address current crises through the logic and value systems that created and continue to drive them. We need responses that are radical in the etymological sense of going to the roots. That is, we need profound shifts in our ways of being, thinking, feeling, and acting: a new cultural paradigm. 
>4. **Real possibility**: A transformation of cultural paradigm is possible and is already starting to happen.

The term “Renaissance”, meaning “rebirth”, is a reference to the 'first' Renaissance: the historical period and cultural movement of the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe, which marked the transition from the Middle Ages to early modernity. Like the First Renaissance, we see the Second Renaissance as a period of cultural and societal rebirth of the Western world, characterised by a profound shift at the civilisational level in our most foundational views and values, such as:
- how we see ourselves and our nature as human beings
- how we approach the relationship between ourselves and the world around us
- what we think is meaningful and important 

We have chosen the term "Second Renaissance" for two main reasons. First, it highlights the process of becoming, rather than predefining a destination, which serves as a reminder that the "end-state" is open-ended and emergent, rather than something that can be fixed ahead of time. In doing so, it also overcomes potential conceptual divisions over the nature of the new paradigm that is or ought to emerge. Second, as with the Renaissance of the 15th and 16th centuries, at the core of the Second Renaissance is the relationship between science and spirituality, reason and intuition. The First Renaissance saw a separation of these fundamental human endeavours and ways of knowing; the Second Renaissance seeks to bring about their re-integration.

# Overview of related names & terms

## Metamodern

> “Metamodernism” is a term used to articulate developments in contemporary culture and society that, some argue, represent a move beyond postmodernism. Metamodernism can be characterised as a move from the irony and cynicism characteristic of postmodernism, towards a yearning for sincere and constructive expression and progression. It is the emergence of an ostensible collective desire for change.” [2](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2022/03/11/mapping-metamodern-what-is-metamodernism)

The term was originally coined in 1975 by Mas’ud Zavarzade to describe an emerging cultural trend in American literature. [3](https://nesslabs.com/metamodernism) Since the publication of Hanzi Freinacht's books *The Listening Society* and *Nordic Ideology* (parts I and II of *A Metamodern Guide to Politics*) in 2017 and 2019, the term 'metamodern' has become a popular way to refer to the Second Renaissance ecosystem and the emerging cultural paradigm that it is seeking to foster.

## Polycrisis

“Polycrisis” refers to “the simultaneous occurrence and interaction of multiple interconnected crises across various domains, creating a complex and intertwined web of challenges.” [4](https://www.realitystudies.co/p/explaining-polycrisis-and-metacrisis)

The term was coined in the 1999 book Homeland Earth: A Manifesto for a New Millennium by Edgar Morin and Anne Brigitte Kern, [5](https://www.realitystudies.co/p/explaining-polycrisis-and-metacrisis) and was recently popularised by historian [Adam Tooze](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-165-polycrisis-thinking). [6](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world) "Polycrisis" has become a relatively mainstream term even outside of the Second Renaissance ecosystem.

## Metacrisis

In an essay titled “[Prefixing the World](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world)”, Jonathan Rowson defines the metacrisis as:

> ”the historically specific threat to truth, beauty, and goodness caused by our persistent misunderstanding, misvaluing, and misappropriating of reality. The metacrisis is the crisis within and between all the world’s major crises, a root cause that is at once singular and plural, a multi-faceted delusion arising from the spiritual and material exhaustion of modernity that permeates the world’s interrelated challenges and manifests institutionally and culturally to the detriment of life on earth.” [7](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world)

The term has gained significant traction within the ecosystem, with its proponents arguing .

## The Liminal Web

In 2021, Joe Lightfoot published a blog post attempting to map “an emergent subculture of sensemakers, meta-theorists & systems poets”, which he termed the “Liminal Web”:

> ”a collection of thinkers, writers, theorists, podcasters, videographers and community builders who all share a high crossover in their collection of perspectives on the world. It not only includes creators of content but also the people and communities who resonate with the constellation of ideas such creators put forward.” [8](https://www.joelightfoot.org/post/the-liminal-web-mapping-an-emergent-subculture-of-sensemakers-meta-theorists-systems-poets)

## Integral

Integral theory is American philosopher Ken Wilber’s attempt to bring everything anyone has ever learnt from any culture into one framework. An integrated approach pursues a holistic view: an integration of mind, body, and spirit; an integration of material and spiritual values; and an integration of Eastern and Western philosophies and worldviews. [9](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2022/05/27/mapping-metamodern-integral)

Since integral theory was first introduced in 1977, a global community of meta-theorists and practitioners has evolved around it. The Second Renaissance ecosystem includes communities and organisations that make significant use of the integral framework, with the term "Integral" being sometimes used to refer to the approach or paradigm that they use or seek to foster, as well as the ecosystem itself.

## The Great Turning

The Great Turning, coined by Joanna Macy, is a shift from the Industrial Growth Society to a life-sustaining civilisation. [10](https://www.ecoliteracy.org/article/great-turning)

## The Regenerative Movement

Originally a movement for ecological sustainability, the term has expanded to include design of regenerative cultures for human and planetary health.

## Game B

Game B is a sense-making community espousing a need for a collective shift from “Game A” (old paradigm) to a new kind of civilisation (“Game B”) that does not reproduce the rivalrous dynamics inherent in Game A which produce existential risk. [11](https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=Game_B)

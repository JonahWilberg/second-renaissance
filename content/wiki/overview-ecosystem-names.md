In recent years, we have observed the emergence of a global network of people and organisations who are acting to catalyse, steward and accelerate what we have called a "Second Renaissance": a major civilisational transition from modernity to a new cultural paradigm. We refer to this growing network as the "Second Renaissance movement" or "Second Renaissance ecosystem". 

However, we recognise that the ecosystem's identity is far from singular or clearly defined. Moreover, while those that we would consider to be part of the Second Renaissance movement tend to resonate with and be motivated by a particular high-level meta-narrative, there can be significant divergence in terms of values, diagnoses, aims, approaches, etc., once things get more specific. 

Some of this diversity is reflected in the language that tends to be used across different parts of the ecosystem, or in different contexts. Specifically, groups and individuals within the space are currently using a range of names and terms to refer to:
- the period of civilisational transition we inhabit, or defining features of it (e.g. Great Turning, Second Renaissance, Metacrisis, Polycrisis)
- the new paradigm or approach that is emerging (e.g. Metamodern, Integral, Regenerative, Game B, Ecological Civilisation)
- the ecosystem or movement itself (e.g. Liminal Web, Sensemaking Web, Emergentsia, Holomovement)

In this post, we provide an overview of some of the most widely used names and terms. It is intended as a resource to learn more about each term, its history, and the thinkers, perspectives and communities that tend to be associated with it. As we add more information over time, we hope that it will contribute towards a deeper understanding of the areas of overlap and divergence within the Second Renaissance ecosystem. 

# Second Renaissance

![[../assets/second-renaissance.png]]

The “Second Renaissance” refers to a major civilisational transition that is currently underway: from the paradigm of modernity, which is breaking down, into what comes next. The Second Renaissance is a time between worlds – a period of civilisational crisis and awakening. In our [introduction to the Second Renaissance](https://secondrenaissance.net/intro), we articulate four core premises of what we see as the underlying meta-narrative:

>1. **Real risk**: There is a real risk of civilisational collapse and large-scale destruction of life due to intertwined ecological, political, social, and meaning crises.
>2. **Root cause**: The root cause of these crises lies in the cultural paradigm of modernity: in entrenched individual and collective ways of being, which are conditioned by modernity’s logic and values. 
>3. **Radical response**: We are unable to address current crises through the logic and value systems that created and continue to drive them. We need responses that are radical in the etymological sense of going to the roots. That is, we need profound shifts in our ways of being, thinking, feeling, and acting: a new cultural paradigm. 
>4. **Real possibility**: A transformation of cultural paradigm is possible and is already starting to happen.

The term “Renaissance”, meaning “rebirth”, is a reference to the 'first' Renaissance: the historical period and cultural movement of the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe, which marked the transition from the Middle Ages to early modernity. Like the First Renaissance, we see the Second Renaissance as a period of cultural and societal rebirth of the Western world, characterised by a profound shift at the civilisational level in our most foundational views and values, such as:
- how we see ourselves and our nature as human beings
- how we approach the relationship between ourselves and the world around us
- what we think is meaningful and important
- our ways of knowing and learning about the world

# Metamodern

![[../assets/metamodern.jpg]]

Broadly speaking, 'metamodernism' is a term used to articulate developments in contemporary culture and society, which are said to represent a move beyond modernism and postmodernism. It was originally coined in 1975 by Mas’ud Zavarzade, to describe an emerging cultural trend in American literature. [3](https://nesslabs.com/metamodernism) More recently, 'metamodernism' has been defined and tends to be used in a number of different ways, which can make it a rather confusing term. 'Metamodernism' is thus – depending on the context – a philosophy, a worldview, a cultural sensibility; as well as a political, scientific, and social movement. 

As a cultural and artistic sensibility, metamodernism is characterised by an oscillation between typically modernist attitudes and postmodernist ones – defined by its “ironic sincerity,” “pragmatic idealism,” and “informed naiveté”. The use of the prefix 'meta' derives from Plato’s *metaxy*, describing an "in-betweeness", an oscillation between diametrically opposed poles of experience.[10](https://systems-souls-society.com/tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis-and-the-appetite-for-a-new-civilisation/) This usage was first proposed by Dutch cultural theorists Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker in their 2010 essay, “Notes on Metamodernism”.[4](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jac.v2i0.5677)

In *The Listening Society* and *Nordic Ideology*, Hanzi Freinacht articulates a political vision and program that has come to be known as 'political metamodernism'. In the books, metamodernism is presented as a philosophy and view of life (or what some call a "cultural paradigm", "cultural logic" or "cultural code") that corresponds to the digitalised, post-industrial, global age. Its key characteristic is the combination of the modern faith in progress with the postmodern critique. This gives rise to a worldview in which "people are on a long, complex developmental journey towards greater complexity and existential depth."[5](https://metamoderna.org/metamodernism/)

# Metacrisis

![[../assets/metacrisis.png]]

In simple terms, the metacrisis is the underlying crisis that drives a multitude of major, interconnected global crises. [10](https://systems-souls-society.com/how-to-think-about-the-meta-crisis-without-getting-too-excited/) 'Meta' means after, beyond, more comprehensive, or transcending. The metacrisis points to the underlying "generator functions" of the various catastrophic and existential risks that we are facing as a civilisation, and in particular highlights the interiority and relationality that are inherent and often neglected aspects of our predicament. Jonathan Rowson writes that addressing the metacrisis necessitates better understanding "who and what we are, individually and collectively, in order to be able to fundamentally alter how we act."[10](https://systems-souls-society.com/how-to-think-about-the-meta-crisis-without-getting-too-excited/) In an essay titled “[Prefixing the World](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world)”, he characterises the metacrisis as arising from "the spiritual and material exhaustion of modernity".

Reflecting the many meanings of the prefix 'meta', there are also many meanings, definitions and attempts to unpack the metacrisis. Zak Stein characterises the metacrisis as a "generalised educational crisis", and differentiates four aspects:[10](https://systems-souls-society.com/education-is-the-metacrisis/)

- a sense-making crisis ("what is the case?")
- a capability crisis ("how can it be done?")
- a legitimacy crisis ("who should do it?")
- a meaning crisis ("why do it?")

Jonathan Rowson identifies ten 'flavours', or kinds, of metacrisis –summarised into four patterns– as a way to highlight the impossibility of pinning it down to a single meaning.[10](https://systems-souls-society.com/tasting-the-pickle-ten-flavours-of-meta-crisis-and-the-appetite-for-a-new-civilisation/) The patterns are:

- The socio-emotional meta/crisis ('meta' as *with*/*within*; the crisis of 'we')
- The educational metacrisis ('meta' as *after*/*within* and *between*; the crisis of education)
- The epistemic meta-crisis ('meta' as *with*/*self-reference*; the crisis of understanding)
- The spiritual meta crisis ('meta' as *beyond*; the crisis of imagination)

The term has gained significant traction within the Second Renaissance ecosystem, primarily through its use by thinkers such as Jonathan Rowson, Daniel Schmachtenberger, Terry Patten and Zak Stein.

# Integral


![[../assets/integral.jpg]]

Integral theory is American philosopher Ken Wilber’s attempt integrate all the known systems and models of human growth into a single, holistic, multidimensional framework for human evolution. An integrated or 'integral' approach to studying human potential seeks an integration of mind, body, and spirit; of material and spiritual values; and of Eastern and Western philosophies and worldviews. [9](https://integrallife.com/what-is-integral-approach/),[10](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2022/05/27/mapping-metamodern-integral) The purpose of an integral approach or 'map' is to see oneself and the world in more comprehensive and effective ways. There are five essential elements of Integral Theory:[10](https://integrallife.com/what-is-integral-approach/)

- **States (of consciousness)**: temporary modes or levels of awareness that individuals can experience (e.g. waking states, dreaming states, meditative states, flow states, altered states, and peak experiences).
- **Levels (or 'stages' of consciousness development)**: permanent milestones of growth and development, representing increasingly higher levels of complexity or organisation.
- **Lines (of development – or 'multiple intelligences')**: domains or dimensions of intelligence along which people can develop (e.g. cognitive, emotional, kinesthetic, interpersonal, moral and self-identity).
- **Types (masculine and feminine)**: a horizontal typology for different versions or dimensions of the same item, such as a stage of development.
- **Quadrants (how all the other components fit together)**: four quadrants displaying the four dimensions of every event – the “I” (inside of the individual), the “it” (outside of the individual), the “we” (inside of the collective), and the “its” (outside of the collective).

Since integral theory was first introduced in 1977 with the publication of *The Spectrum of Consciousness*, a global community of meta-theorists and practitioners has evolved around it. The Second Renaissance ecosystem includes communities and organisations that make significant use of the integral framework, with the term "integral" being sometimes used to refer to the approach or paradigm that they are seeking to foster, as well as the ecosystem itself.

# Polycrisis

![[../assets/polycrisis.png]]

The "polycrisis" is defined by the Cascade Institute as "any combination of three or more interacting systemic risks with the potential to cause a cascading, runaway failure of Earth’s natural and social systems that irreversibly and catastrophically degrades humanity’s prospects."[10](https://cascadeinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/What-is-a-global-polycrisis-v2.pdf) Essentially, a polycrisis arises when multiple systems across various domains are in crisis simultaneously, and interact with each other to create a "complex and intertwined web of challenges.” [4](https://www.realitystudies.co/p/explaining-polycrisis-and-metacrisis)

The term was coined in the 1999 book Homeland Earth: A Manifesto for a New Millennium by Edgar Morin and Anne Brigitte Kern, [5](https://www.realitystudies.co/p/explaining-polycrisis-and-metacrisis) and was recently popularised by historian [Adam Tooze](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-165-polycrisis-thinking). [6](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world) "Polycrisis" has become a relatively mainstream term, both within and outside of the Second Renaissance ecosystem. In 2022, it was chosen by the Financial Times as the word to describe the year.[7](https://www.ft.com/content/f6c4f63c-aa71-46f0-a0a7-c2a4c4a3c0f1) It is sometimes used interchangeably with the term 'metacrisis', although the two concepts are distinct.

# The Liminal Web


![[../assets/liminal-web.png]]

In 2021, Joe Lightfoot published a blog post attempting to map “an emergent subculture of sensemakers, meta-theorists & systems poets”, which he termed the “Liminal Web”:

> ”a collection of thinkers, writers, theorists, podcasters, videographers and community builders who all share a high crossover in their collection of perspectives on the world. It not only includes creators of content but also the people and communities who resonate with the constellation of ideas such creators put forward.” [8](https://www.joelightfoot.org/post/the-liminal-web-mapping-an-emergent-subculture-of-sensemakers-meta-theorists-systems-poets)

'Liminal' means ‘to occupy a position at, or on both sides of, a boundary or threshold’. The choice of this word reflects the idea that "everyone in the space is in their own unique way attempting to mid-wife a new kind of regenerative culture whilst simultaneously hospicing the old".[8](https://www.joelightfoot.org/post/the-liminal-web-mapping-an-emergent-subculture-of-sensemakers-meta-theorists-systems-poets) 'The Liminal Web' has since become a popular term for referring to the emerging ecosystem.

# The Great Turning

![[../assets/great-turning.jpeg]]

The Great Turning, coined by Joanna Macy, is a shift from the Industrial Growth Society to a life-sustaining civilisation. [10](https://www.ecoliteracy.org/article/great-turning) Macy identifies three main narratives of our times: "the Great Unraveling"

According to Macy, there are three dimensions of the Great Turning – that is, three 'types' of actions that are needed for the transition to occur:

- Actions to slow the damage to Earth and its beings (aka "holding actions")
- Analysis of structural causes and the creation of structural alternatives (aka "structural changes")
- Shift in Consciousness (i.e. a profound shift in our perception of reality, including values and norms)

Narrative: Great unravelling - we are on trajectory towards collapse, but we have possibility for great turning instead (something radically different)

# The Regenerative Movement

![[../assets/sustainble-vs-regenerative.webp]]

The concept of regeneration – and the social movement associated with it – can be contrasted with the more widely known concept of sustainability. While sustainability is about leaving the environment "as you found it" by seeking to neutralise negative impacts, regeneration is about replenishing, restoring, or enhancing – actively seeking to improve an ecosystem's resilience and capacity to regenerate. An example of regeneration is the restoration of Loess Plateau in China in 1994, where the Chinese government and the World Bank collaborated on restoring biodiversity and life-systems in nearly 4 million acres of over-grazed, over-harvested lands in north-central China.[10](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2007/03/15/restoring-chinas-loess-plateau)

In recent years, a regenerative approach has been increasingly applied to the design of cultures and human systems. Key principles involve seeing ourselves as living in patterns of relationships, rather than as separate individuals; seeing these relationships as part of wider living systems; and seeing these patterns as constantly evolving and emerging processes. [11](https://designforsustainability.medium.com/graham-leicester-introduces-designing-regenerative-cultures-4789f3631699) Given the significant overlap in terms of values and principles with what we are calling the Second Renaissance ecosystem, 'regenerative' could be seen either as a synonymous term, or as pointing to something that is closely adjacent to it.

# GameB

![[../assets/gameb.png]]

Game B is a sense-making community espousing a need for a collective shift from “Game A” (old paradigm) to a new kind of civilisation (“Game B”) that does not reproduce the rivalrous dynamics inherent in Game A which produce existential risk. [11](https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=Game_B)

Game B is a sense-making community espousing a need for a collective shift from “Game A” (old paradigm) to a new kind of civilisation (“Game B”).

It draws on game theory for its theoretical framework. In those terms, the idea is that Game B does not reproduce the rivalrous dynamics inherent in Game A which produce existential risk

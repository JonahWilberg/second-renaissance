In recent years, we have observed the emergence of a global network of people and organisations who are acting to catalyse, steward and accelerate what we have called a "[Second Renaissance](https://secondrenaissance.net/intro)": a major civilisational transition from modernity to a new cultural paradigm. We refer to this growing network as the "Second Renaissance movement" or "Second Renaissance ecosystem". 

However, we recognise that the ecosystem's identity is far from singular or clearly defined. Moreover, while those that we would consider to be part of the Second Renaissance movement tend to resonate with and be motivated by a particular meta-narrative,[^1] there can be significant divergence in terms of values, diagnoses, aims, approaches, etc., at a higher level of concreteness and specificity. 

Some of this diversity is reflected in the language that tends to be used across different parts of the ecosystem. Specifically, different groups and individuals within the space are using a range of names and terms to refer to:
- the period of civilisational transition we inhabit, or defining features of it (e.g. Great Turning, Second Renaissance, Metacrisis, Polycrisis)
- the new paradigm or approach that is emerging (e.g. Metamodern, Integral, Regenerative, Game B)
- the ecosystem itself (e.g. Liminal Web, Emergentsia)

In this post, we briefly outline the reasons for choosing the term "Second Renaissance", and provide an overview of some of the other most widely used names and terms. It is intended as a resource to learn more about each term, its history, and the thinkers, perspectives and communities that tend to be associated with it. As we add more information over time, we hope that it will contribute towards a deeper understanding of the areas of overlap and divergence within the Second Renaissance ecosystem. 

[^1]: See our [introduction to the Second Renaissance](https://secondrenaissance.net/intro) for an articulation of the four core premises of the Second Renaissance.

# Second Renaissance

![[../assets/second-renaissance.png]]

The “Second Renaissance” refers to a major civilisational transition that is currently underway: from the paradigm of modernity, which is breaking down, into what comes next. The Second Renaissance is a time between worlds – a period of civilisational crisis and awakening. In our [introduction to the Second Renaissance](https://secondrenaissance.net/intro), we articulate four core premises of what we see as the underlying meta-narrative:

>1. **Real risk**: There is a real risk of civilisational collapse and large-scale destruction of life due to intertwined ecological, political, social, and meaning crises.
>2. **Root cause**: The root cause of these crises lies in the cultural paradigm of modernity: in entrenched individual and collective ways of being, which are conditioned by modernity’s logic and values. 
>3. **Radical response**: We are unable to address current crises through the logic and value systems that created and continue to drive them. We need responses that are radical in the etymological sense of going to the roots. That is, we need profound shifts in our ways of being, thinking, feeling, and acting: a new cultural paradigm. 
>4. **Real possibility**: A transformation of cultural paradigm is possible and is already starting to happen.

The term “Renaissance”, meaning “rebirth”, is a reference to the 'first' Renaissance: the historical period and cultural movement of the 15th and 16th centuries in Europe, which marked the transition from the Middle Ages to early modernity. Like the First Renaissance, we see the Second Renaissance as a period of cultural and societal rebirth of the Western world, characterised by a profound shift at the civilisational level in our most foundational views and values, such as:
- how we see ourselves and our nature as human beings
- how we approach the relationship between ourselves and the world around us
- what we think is meaningful and important
- our ways of knowing and learning about the world

# Metamodern

![[../assets/metamodern.jpg]]

Broadly speaking, 'metamodernism' is a term used to articulate developments in contemporary culture and society, which are said to represent a move beyond modernism and postmodernism. It was originally coined in 1975 by Mas’ud Zavarzade, to describe an emerging cultural trend in American literature. [3](https://nesslabs.com/metamodernism) More recently, 'metamodernism' has been defined and tends to be used in a number of different ways, which can make it a rather confusing term. 'Metamodernism' is thus – depending on the context – a philosophy, a worldview, a cultural sensibility; as well as a political, scientific, and social movement. 

As a cultural and artistic sensibility, metamodernism is characterised by an oscillation between typically modernist attitudes and postmodernist ones – defined by its “ironic sincerity,” “pragmatic idealism,” and “informed naiveté”. The use of the prefix 'meta' derives from Plato’s *metaxis*, describing a state of being "in-between" diametrically opposed poles. This usage was first proposed by Dutch cultural theorists Timotheus Vermeulen and Robin van den Akker in their 2010 essay, “Notes on Metamodernism”.[4](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3402/jac.v2i0.5677)

In *The Listening Society* and *Nordic Ideology*, Hanzi Freinacht articulates a political vision and program that has come to be known as 'political metamodernism'. In the books, metamodernism is presented as a philosophy and view of life (or what some call a "cultural paradigm", "cultural logic" or "cultural code") that corresponds to the digitalised, post-industrial, global age. Its key characteristic is the combination of the modern faith in progress with the postmodern critique. This gives rise to a worldview in which "people are on a long, complex developmental journey towards greater complexity and existential depth."[5](https://metamoderna.org/metamodernism/)

# Metacrisis

![[../assets/metacrisis.png]]

In an essay titled “[Prefixing the World](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world)”, Jonathan Rowson defines the metacrisis as:

> ”the historically specific threat to truth, beauty, and goodness caused by our persistent misunderstanding, misvaluing, and misappropriating of reality. The metacrisis is the crisis within and between all the world’s major crises, a root cause that is at once singular and plural, a multi-faceted delusion arising from the spiritual and material exhaustion of modernity that permeates the world’s interrelated challenges and manifests institutionally and culturally to the detriment of life on earth.” [7](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world)

The term has gained significant traction within the ecosystem, with its proponents arguing .

Meta means after, beyond, more comprehensive, or transcending.

According to Jonathan Rowson, “The metacrisis is the underlying crisis driving a multitude of crises”. “We have to better understand who and what we are, individually and collectively, in order to be able to fundamentally change how we act.” 

More fundamental than the polycrisis; while the polycrisis is about stuff happening ‘out there’, the metacrisis points to interiority and relationality

# Integral

![[../assets/integral.jpg]]

Integral theory is American philosopher Ken Wilber’s attempt to bring everything anyone has ever learnt from any culture into one framework. An integrated approach pursues a holistic view: an integration of mind, body, and spirit; an integration of material and spiritual values; and an integration of Eastern and Western philosophies and worldviews. [9](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2022/05/27/mapping-metamodern-integral)

Since integral theory was first introduced in 1977, a global community of meta-theorists and practitioners has evolved around it. The Second Renaissance ecosystem includes communities and organisations that make significant use of the integral framework, with the term "Integral" being sometimes used to refer to the approach or paradigm that they use or seek to foster, as well as the ecosystem itself.

American philosopher Ken Wilber’s Integral Theory attempts to integrate different approaches and frameworks into a single, holistic view.
It seeks an integration of mind, body, and spirit; an integration of material and spiritual values; and an integration of Eastern and Western philosophies and worldviews

# Polycrisis

![[../assets/polycrisis.png]]

The "polycrisis" is defined by the World Economic Forum's 2023 Global Risks Report as "a cluster of related global risks with compounding effects, such that the overall impact exceeds the sum of each part."[10](chrome-extension://efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www3.weforum.org/docs/WEF_Global_Risks_Report_2023.pdf) Essentially, a polycrisis arises when multiple systems across various domains are in crisis simultaneously, and interact with each other to create a "complex and intertwined web of challenges.” [4](https://www.realitystudies.co/p/explaining-polycrisis-and-metacrisis)

The term was coined in the 1999 book Homeland Earth: A Manifesto for a New Millennium by Edgar Morin and Anne Brigitte Kern, [5](https://www.realitystudies.co/p/explaining-polycrisis-and-metacrisis) and was recently popularised by historian [Adam Tooze](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-165-polycrisis-thinking). [6](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world) "Polycrisis" has become a relatively mainstream term, both within and outside of the Second Renaissance ecosystem. In 2022, it was chosen by the Financial Times as the word to describe that year.[7](https://www.ft.com/content/f6c4f63c-aa71-46f0-a0a7-c2a4c4a3c0f1) It is sometimes used interchangeably with the term 'metacrisis', although the two concepts are distinct.

# The Liminal Web


![[../assets/liminal-web.png]]

In 2021, Joe Lightfoot published a blog post attempting to map “an emergent subculture of sensemakers, meta-theorists & systems poets”, which he termed the “Liminal Web”:

> ”a collection of thinkers, writers, theorists, podcasters, videographers and community builders who all share a high crossover in their collection of perspectives on the world. It not only includes creators of content but also the people and communities who resonate with the constellation of ideas such creators put forward.” [8](https://www.joelightfoot.org/post/the-liminal-web-mapping-an-emergent-subculture-of-sensemakers-meta-theorists-systems-poets)

# The Great Turning

![[../assets/great-turning.jpeg]]

The Great Turning, coined by Joanna Macy, is a shift from the Industrial Growth Society to a life-sustaining civilisation. [10](https://www.ecoliteracy.org/article/great-turning)

3 types of actions needed:
Holding actions (limit or reduce harm)
Structural changes (building new societal forms, new economies, etc.)
Shift in consciousness (shifting cultural values and norms)

Narrative: Great unravelling - we are on trajectory towards collapse, but we have possibility for great turning instead (something radically different)

Probably one of the less commonly used terms in this space

# The Regenerative Movement

![[../assets/sustainble-vs-regenerative.webp]]

The regenerative movement was originally a response to the shortcomings of the sustainability movement. While sustainability is about leaving the environment "as you found it" by seeking to neutralise negative impacts, regeneration is about replenishing, restoring, or enhancing – actively seeking to improve an ecosystem's resilience and capacity to regenerate. An example of regeneration is the restoration of Loess Plateau in China in 1994, where the Chinese government and the World Bank collaborated on restoring biodiversity and life-systems in nearly 4 million acres of over-grazed, over-harvested  lands in north-central China.[10](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/feature/2007/03/15/restoring-chinas-loess-plateau)

In recent years, a regenerative approach has been increasingly applied to the design of 'regenerative' cultures and human systems. 'Regenerative' has also been used as a term for referring to the Second Renaissance ecosystem, or parts of it.

# GameB

![[../assets/gameb.png]]

Game B is a sense-making community espousing a need for a collective shift from “Game A” (old paradigm) to a new kind of civilisation (“Game B”) that does not reproduce the rivalrous dynamics inherent in Game A which produce existential risk. [11](https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=Game_B)

Game B is a sense-making community espousing a need for a collective shift from “Game A” (old paradigm) to a new kind of civilisation (“Game B”).

It draws on game theory for its theoretical framework. In those terms, the idea is that Game B does not reproduce the rivalrous dynamics inherent in Game A which produce existential risk
